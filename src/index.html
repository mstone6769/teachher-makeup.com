    <h2>About Lina</h2>
    <p>HELLO, My name is Lina and welcome to the Teach/Her Community, all are welcome here!</p>
    <p>I spent a number of years as a freelance makeup artist, as well as working for various cosmetic companies and makeup studios. But I wish I could say that I was always so confident in knowing what my giftings were and knowing what I had to offer this world, sister, that’s not my story. Vulnerability is welcome here, so I’ll start…</p>

    <p>Aside from working in the beauty and skincare industry, I also wore many other hats and tried my hand at countless positions but nothing ever quite felt like the right fit. Things were always falling through, disappointment always seemed to lurking around the corner, I kept letting comparison steal my joy, but the longing to help women always lingered in my soul, and I kept praying for God to bring it forth and open the right doors.</p>

    <p>After I realized how burned out I was from the hustle and bustle of doing makeup for weddings, feeling like my creative muscles had not been worked in quite some time, feeling unfulfilled, like I wasn’t doing anything to help my community of women, and after a major career disappointment, I cried out in desperation. One day I was sitting alone in our office at home wracking my brain, I heard the word “Teacher”, but it was more separated like “Teach her”, and I decided to sit with it and explore its meaning.
    </p>

    <p>So here we are! I took my passion for the empowerment of women, my love for beauty, relationships, encouragement, one-on-one connection, the desire to help women of all ages to see the crazy unique beauty that they house, and decided to channel all of that into a crazy direction. I am here to Teach/Her! I am an on-site, one-on-one makeup teacher, offering classes for every age and stage of life. Striving to empower you, cheering you on to help build confidence, and giving you the tools to take the makeup brush into your own hands! Head over to the (link here) Teach/Her Approach to learn more!
    </p>

    <p>I hope i’ll get to spend time with you soon!
    </p>

    <p>Love,</p>
    <p>Lina</p>
